# 3D Solar System Simulation - Frontend Assignment

## Overview
This project is an interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js. It features all 8 planets orbiting the Sun with realistic animations, customizable speed controls, and an immersive space environment.

## Features
- **Realistic 3D Solar System**: Sun at the center with all 8 planets in orbit
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust individual planet speeds in real-time
- **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Control the simulation playback
- **Planet Tooltips**: Hover over planets to see their names
- **Camera Rotation**: Drag to rotate the view around the solar system
- **Starry Background**: Immersive space environment with stars
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Live Server extension for VS Code

### Installation & Running
1. Unzip the project folder
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the "Live Server" extension if you don't have it
4. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
5. The simulation will open in your default browser

## Controls
- **Planet Speed**: Use the sliders or number inputs to adjust each planet's orbital speed
- **Pause/Resume**: Click the "Pause Simulation" button to stop the animation
- **Camera Rotation**: Click and drag on the simulation to rotate the view
- **Planet Identification**: Hover over any planet to see its name

## Technical Details
- Built with Three.js v0.178.0
- Uses physically based rendering for realistic lighting
- Implements THREE.Clock for accurate animation timing
- Responsive design with CSS Flexbox and media queries
- Mobile-friendly interface
